<font face="Bradley hand itc " color="#FFC0CB" align="right">Luke Hemmings is my favorite member not just because of his lip piercing and blue eyes and his dimples, but also because he is. He's the type that is shy and quiet which is like me. Since he was bullied and I was bullied I can finally relate to someone is now somewhat famous. He is not like any of other members nor like any other lead singers. He puts in his all when perforimg and writing songs. One of the songs he wrote actually stuck out to me. "Rejects". Basically it is about being a rejct not only to others but also to society. Also another one is "Social Casualty". He is a very talented and CUTE person.</font>
